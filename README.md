This repository demonstrates a common Python error: ZeroDivisionError. The `bug.py` file contains a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. It does not handle the case where an empty list is provided, leading to a ZeroDivisionError.  The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to add a check for an empty list to prevent this error.
